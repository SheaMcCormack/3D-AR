3. Implement Marker Detection:
Marker detection is crucial for recognizing the calibration sheet in the real world. Here's how you can implement it:

Using AR Frameworks: If you're using ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android), they offer built-in APIs for marker detection. You would typically define the properties of the calibration sheet (e.g., size, shape, unique features) and use the AR framework's functions to detect it in the camera feed.

Custom Marker Detection: If you're not using AR frameworks or need more control, you can implement marker detection using computer vision libraries like OpenCV. Techniques such as feature detection (e.g., SIFT, SURF) or template matching can be employed to identify the calibration sheet.

4. Calibration Sheet Setup:
The calibration sheet serves as the reference point for scaling and positioning the virtual objects. Here's what you need to consider:

Dimensions: Design the calibration sheet with known dimensions. You can use a ruler to measure its size accurately. For example, you might create a square sheet that is 8.5 inches by 11 inches.

Features: Include distinct visual features on the calibration sheet. These features will be used for marker detection. They could be patterns, symbols, or QR codes that are easily recognizable by your marker detection algorithm.

5. Calibration Process:
Calibrating your AR system involves establishing a correspondence between virtual and real-world coordinates. Here's how you can perform the calibration:

Measure Known Distance: Place the calibration sheet on a flat surface where you intend to use your AR application. Measure a known distance on the calibration sheet using a physical ruler. For example, you might measure the distance between two corners of the sheet.

Detect Distance in Camera Feed: When the marker detection algorithm identifies the calibration sheet in the camera feed, measure the distance between the detected corners using computer vision techniques. This distance will be in pixels.

Calculate Scale Factor: Calculate the scale factor by dividing the known distance in real-world units by the detected distance in pixels. This scale factor will be used to scale your virtual objects correctly in the AR scene.

Apply Scale Factor: Use the calculated scale factor to adjust the scale of your virtual scene. This ensures that virtual objects appear at the correct size relative to the real world.
